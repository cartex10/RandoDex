# RandoDex 

#### A program that takes in the log file of a randomized ROM an helps in showing the location of the randomized pokemon 

## How Does It Work? 
This program works in conjunction with the Universal Pokemon Game Randomizer, [found here](https://pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/index.php)

When a game is put through the randomizer, there is an option to output the log file, which holds information on which pokemon can be found on each route. This file is long, tedious to search through, and unsportsmanlike to use. This program reads through the file and allows the user to select a pokemon and see what locations it can be found in, just like the ingame pokedex! 

## Current Features
* Currently works exclusively for heartgold/soulsilver (Up to Gen V planned)
* Shows pokemon location directly on map
* Uses sprites from the respective games
